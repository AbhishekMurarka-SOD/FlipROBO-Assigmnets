    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project we have to build a system which summarizes the customer reviews of a particular product into a bunch of keywords, so that when a customer goes to a product page, he/she doesn’t have to read long reviews. Instead he/she can make up his/her mind based on the product average rating and summarized keywords of the review. \n",
    "For this problem you may use any tools and techniques you like. The data consists of reviews and ratings information of the products which are being sold by the client via online website. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data description is as follows: \n",
    "DATA DESCRIPTION: \n",
    "You are given a file named “Cell_Phones_and_Accessories.json”. This file contains review information under following columns:  IC – Item Code of the product, e.g. B016MF3P3K   \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewer_Name - Name of the reviewer  \n",
    "\n",
    "Useful- Number of useful votes (upvotes) of the review  Prod_meta- a dictionary of the product metadata. It contains only additional information about the product, if any available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Review- text of the review  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rating- rating given to the product by the reviewer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rev_summ- summary of the review  Review_timestamp- time when the review has been posted (unix time format)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Review_Date- Date when the review has been posted  Prod_img- images that users post after they have received the product  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rev_verify- Flag to represent whether the review has been verified or not. (True/False) \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since you have understood the features present in the dataset, you have to do a proper data cleaning for the same. You may remove all the rows where no review is present. You may choose any column(s) to perform this task. You may perform EDA, feature engineering if you are able to find any important new feature. \n",
    "Once you have done data pre-processing for all the products, you have to predict the important words which summarize the reviews for each product and thus return those words. Number of words extracted for each topic depends on your understanding, you need to give a suitable reason for the number you choose. The summary keywords should not contain more than 30 words. "

       "'Bought it for my husband. He\\'s very happy with it He\\'s very happy with,Good product.  Does exactly what the description says it will do. I recommend buying this product. Leather case holder,This is a very nice case for medium to larger smartphones.  My Droid Razor Maxx fits very nicely, the belt clip is strong spring steel, and the magnetic clasp holds very well for a magnetic design. Nice leather smartphone case,Appears to be excellent product. Fits the phone very nicely even with the hard shell back I have on my phone. I like the fact it has a belt loop and well as the clip that slides over the belt. The loop ensures the case will not come off the belt yet you have the option of just using the clip when you have to quickly remove the phone.  Time will tell concerning the durability.  The price is hard to beat. Exceptional Value,Great fit for iPhone 5 with protective case on - yes you read correctly.  Needed a belt clip to hold iPhone 5 that has a thin protective case already on. This works perfectly. Price is very good too. Works with iPhone 5 and Ballistic,The quality of this case feels nice and solid.\\nMy only complaint is that it\\'s a little larger to support protective cases for the phone and since I don\\'t use one there\\'s a lot of extra room for my phone to move around in. Nice, solid case for the phone. Large enough to support protective cases.,Good phone \"holster\" with belt loops and clip.  Phone fits well and appearance is as described. Good phone \"holster\" at a reasonable price,[July 9, 2013] After I picked up \" Body Glove 9314201 DropSuit Rugged Case for Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black\" from seller for 9.67USD, I realized it was awesome - but since the phone won\\'t fit into this \"Hedocell\" case when the phone is in the body glove, I have not used this case pouch.\\n\\nCONtributing factor: it smelled \"to high heaven\" when I opened the package.  Today, more than a month later, the smell much less detectable, but for a few weeks....whew! Be prepared not to use it right away...\\n\\nI\\'ve kept it, and will try to \\'stretch\\' it to fit my Razr Maxx HD with the body glove...it would be nice to have this on my belt.\\n\\nUpdate nearly a year later.  It still sits on a shelf.  The Body Glove has saved me several times, so that takes priority over having this case. I would not recommend you buy it if you are using something like Body Glove to protect your Razr Maxx. It is too tight for a Raxr Maxx HD inside a DropSuit...without some stretching (oh, and it smells too),Better than I would expect, been using it daily for a few months with no issues.  So far it is holding up great. My Motorola Droid HD Maxx fits perfectly with a small protective cover on it. Really nice case,The case is as it was explained.  However, it does not have enough room to hold the Droid Razr Maxx HD with another cover on the phone.  I have and OtterBox on my phone now, but have ordered a smaller case.  Hopefully that cover will fit inside this holster.  I really do like the look of the holster.  One of the elastic bands on the side seems to be a tad loose, but time will tell how my new case fits inside this holster and how the holster holds up.  Thus far, I\\'m a fan. Time Will Tell,This case is quite durable. Excellent price. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Goes on your belt loop. magnetic closer Droid phone case,Happy husband Five Stars'"
